/*public class CountPaths {


    *//*The task is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix with the constraints that
     from each cell you can either move only to right or down.
    Input: First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case consists of N and M, denoting the number of rows
     and number of column respectively.
    Output:
    Single line output i.e count of all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix.
    Since output can be very large number use %10^9+7.*//*
